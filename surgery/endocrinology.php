                <h2>Types of Dieseases</h2>
                <h1>Adrenal insufficiency</h1>
                <p>The adrenal gland releases too little of the hormone cortisol and sometimes, aldosterone.</p>
                <p>
                    Addison’s disease is a rare disorder that affects men and women of all ages. Addison’s disease is also referred to as primary adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency develops when your adrenal glandsdo not produce enough of the hormone cortisol. This can be due to a problem within the adrenals (called Addison’s disease or primary adrenal insufficiency) or due to a problem with the signal the brain sends to the adrenals instructing them to make cortisol (called secondary adrenal insufficiency).
                    An important distinction for patients is that people with primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease) usually don’t make enough of the hormone aldosterone; so in addition to taking cortisol replacement, they also need aldosterone replacement. People with secondary adrenal insufficiency are only low on cortisol. Cortisol and aldosterone are just two of the more than 50 hormones the adrenal glands generate. One adrenal gland sits directly above each kidney.</p>
                <h2> Symptoms of Adrenal Insufficiency</h2>
                <p>Symptoms of Addison’s disease and secondary adrenal insufficiency may slowly develop and progress. Common symptoms include:</p>
                <li> Weakness</li>
                <li>Fatigue</li>
                <li>Abdominal pain</li>
                <li>Nausea</li>
                <li>Weight loss</li>
                <li>Low blood pressure</li>
                <li>Darkened skin (in the case of Addison’s disease)</li>
                <li>Salt craving (in the case of Addison’s disease)</li>
                <li>Dizziness upon standing</li>
                <li>Depression</li>

                However, there are different causes of Addison’s disease that can influence the symptoms.
                <h1>Cushing's disease</h1>
                <p>Overproduction of a pituitary gland hormone leads to an overactive adrenal gland.</p>
                <h1>Gigantism (acromegaly) and other growth hormone problems</h1>
                <h2>Acromegaly</h2>
                <p>Acromegaly is a growth disorder caused by too much growth hormone (GH) being released by the pituitary gland, leading to excessive growth.</p>
                <p>When GH is released at normal levels, it promotes healthy growth. Too much of it, though, is a serious—but rare—endocrine disorder. The incidence of acromegaly (how frequent it occurs) is very low: About 3 to 4 people in every 1 million people will be diagnosed with acromegaly every year1.</p>
                <p>Of course, GH is very important in children because it helps their bones and muscles develop (especially during those "growth spurts").</p>
                <p>GH continues to be released, even after you're done growing. In adults, growth hormone influences how much energy you have, how healthy your bones are, how strong you are, and even your overall sense of well-being.
                    Acromegaly is characterized by overgrowth, and it's typically first noticed in the hands and feet. In fact, acro- means extremity in Greek. And the mega part of the word means large (originally in Greek, but English uses the word in the same way). Putting the root words together, acromegaly means large extremities.
                    However, acromegaly affects more than just your extremities. If your pituitary gland is releasing too much growth hormone (find out why in the article on acromegaly causes, your internal organs can be affected, as well as your joints. See a full list of symptoms related to acromegaly .</p>
                <p>In children, acromegaly is called gigantism. Usually, though, acromegaly is diagnosed in adults—especially middle-aged people. This article series will focus on acromegaly, but we do include some information about gigantism.</p>
